# New Requirement

- Return 401 status code and JSON format error message when verification fails
- Add functionality to obtain JWT based on username and password. The generated JWT token's payload sub should be username, with an expiration time of 30 days
- JWT token comes from the `Authorization` header field in the format `Bearer <token>`, and also supports passing JWT Token through the x-api-key query parameter
